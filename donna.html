<div class="mainContainer">

    <p>This is an excerpt from Dr.Donna Oriowo's article 'Black Hair and Mental Health: A Tale of Texturism'. Here she talks about how texturism can impact mental health.</p>
<p>When we talk about texturism, we are ultimately talking about self-worth and value. As I said before this country’s evaluation system is founded on one’s proximity to whiteness. Even with regards to hair texture, the closer you are to Eurocentric standards of beauty the better off you are. Those who do not meet and/or cannot conform to meet these standards are left at the bottom of society’s hierarchy. They are the ones who are left to constantly consider how they are being perceived by others in ways that some of our brothers and sisters don’t have to because their hair texture is working in their favor. This constant worry of perception can breed anxiety, self-doubt, and low self-esteem.

<p>
For those of you who have hair down your back or “pretty” curls, I’m sure you walk out your door every morning with a bit more confidence than the woman whose hair was considered nappy all of her life. While kinky hair may be considered something worth bragging about today, it wasn’t always, so those negative thoughts and feelings you experienced growing up can very much still have an impact on you today. It may be the reason why you’re worried about your hair when having sex or why you feel you need to check the mirror every time you pass one. Because deep down you’re trying to make sure that you’re still “presentable” and considered worthy.
</p>
<p>As a grown woman, dealing with texturism can be overwhelming, so you can only imagine what our young girls are going through.

Black girls, as young as six, understand the social capital of “good” hair and the “right” skin tone. Regardless of how many times mommy and daddy tell them that their kinky beautiful hair is perfect as is, they still feel as though they have less value than other girls. This negative perception often can lead them to feeling as if they must be willing to do more things for other people or overcompensate in other aspects of their lives so they can be seen as worthwhile, including having fewer boundaries or doing things that make them feel uncomfortable to fit in.</p>
