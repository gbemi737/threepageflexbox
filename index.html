    What is Texturism?
  </h1>
  <p>Texturism can be thought of as the discrimination faced by those with coarser and more Afro-textured hair. Texturism is based on the premise that hair textures closer to white are more acceptable
</p>
<h1>Is It Really That Harmful?</h1>
<p>Yes, it may not seem like a big deal but it is another limiting factor that black people have to deal with from young. Donna Oriowo is licensed independent clinical social worker she speaks on the trauma of texturism. She says "It absolutely is appropriate to use the word ‘trauma’ to describe some of the experiences Black women have had with regard to their hair;By the time a Black girl is six, she knows the value of having the ‘right’ hair texture and skin tone. That means she is also aware of her value relative to others, how they receive her, and is able to feel the harm … even if she doesn't have the vocabulary to describe it"</p>
<h1>My Story</h1>
<p>Really I have a bunch of stories but two situations stick out the most. I was in the bathroom with a my white friend. We were freshining up when she looked at me and reached from my hair. "I love your hair, it's so fun!" she said. My other friend comes into the bathroom directly after, she's indian with wavy, bouncy hair. "actuallly i want her hair,I love the way it moves" as she reaches for her hair. I didn't even think much of it at the time but that was like 4 years ago and my mind goes back to that memory often. Another time I was younger and had just recently cut out the relaxer that straightened my hair, agaisnt my moms wishes. I had to take my passport photo and I thought it was the perfect time to debut my new afro. As soon as my mom sees me, she's truly confused. "your not going out like that right?" "I am." I said. "you're gonna look like a crazy person, they'll kick us out of the passport office" the thought of my leaving the house in the natural state of my hair astonished my mom, I don't even blame her is what's really sad.</p>
